# 1.1 Finite Difference Approximations

Let $u(x)$ represent a smooth function of one variable over an interval containing a particular point of interest $\bar{x}$.
To approximate $u'(\bar{x})$ by a finite difference approximation based only on values of $u$ at a finite number of points near $\bar{x}$, one obvious choice would be 
$$D_{+} u(\bar{x}) \equiv \frac{u(\bar{x}+h)-u(\bar{x})}{h} \quad (1.1.1)$$
for some small value of $h$, which is a **one-sided approximation** to $u'$ since $u$ is evaluated only at values of $x\geq\bar{x}$.

Another one-sided approximation would be
$$D_{-} u(\bar{x}) \equiv \frac{u(\bar{x})-u(\bar{x}-h)}{h}. \quad (1.1.2)$$

Each of these formulas gives a **first order accurate approximation** to $u'(\bar{x})$, meaning that the size of the error $E(h) \equiv Du(\bar{x})-u'(\bar{x})$ is proportional to $h$.

Another option is to use the **centered approximation**
$$D_0 u(\bar{x}) \equiv \frac{u(\bar{x}+h)-u(\bar{x}-h)}{2 h}=\frac{1}{2}\left(D_{+} u(\bar{x})+D_{-} u(\bar{x})\right) \quad (1.1.3)$$
that gives a **second order accurate approximation**. It has an error proportional to $h^2$ and gives a better approximation than either of the one-side approximations.

## 1.1.1 Truncation errors

The standard approach to analyzing the error in a finite difference approximation is to expand each of the function values of $u$ in a **Taylor series** $$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k+O\left((x-a)^{n+1}\right)$$ about the point $\bar{x}$ provided that $u$ is sufficiently smooth, for example, 
$$u(\bar{x}+h)=u(\bar{x})+h u^{\prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{2} h^2 u^{\prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{6} h^3 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{24} h^4 u^{(4)}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^5\right), \quad (1.1.4a)$$
$$u(\bar{x}-h)=u(\bar{x})-h u^{\prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{2} h^2 u^{\prime \prime}(\bar{x})-\frac{1}{6} h^3 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{24} h^4 u^{(4)}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^5\right). \quad (1.1.4b)$$

Using $(1.1.4a)$ and $(1.1.4b)$ could compute that
$$D_{+} u(\bar{x})=\frac{u(\bar{x}+h)-u(\bar{x})}{h}=u^{\prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{2} h u^{\prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{6} h^2 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{24} h^3 u^{(4)}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^4\right),$$
$$D_{-} u(\bar{x})=\frac{u(\bar{x})-u(\bar{x}-h)}{h}=u^{\prime}(\bar{x})-\frac{1}{2} h u^{\prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{6} h^2 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})-\frac{1}{24} h^3 u^{(4)}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^4\right),$$
$$D_0 u(\bar{x})=\frac{1}{2}\left(D_{+} u(\bar{x})+D_{-} u(\bar{x})\right)=u^{\prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{6} h^2 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^4\right).$$

Then the error in $D_0 u(\bar{x})$ is
$$D_0 u(\bar{x})-u^{\prime}(\bar{x})=\frac{1}{6} h^2 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^4\right).$$
For $h$ sufficiently small, the error will be dominated by the first term $\frac{1}{6} h^2 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})$ and all the other terms will be negligible. So the error is expected to behave like a constant times $h^2$, where the contant has the value $\frac{1}{6}u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})$. This confirms the **second order accuracy** of this approximation. 

Note that all the odd order terms of $h$ drop out of the Taylor series expansion for $D_0 u(\bar{x})$. This is typical with centered approximations and generally leads to a higher order approximation.

## 1.1.2 Derivation of finite difference approximations

The **method of undetermined coefficients** can be used to derive a finite difference approximation to $u'(\bar{x})$ based on a given set of points. 
To give a one-sided approximation to $u'(\bar{x})$ based on $u(\bar{x})$, $u(\bar{x}-h)$, and $u(\bar{x}-2h)$ in the form of
$$D_2 u(\bar{x})=au(\bar{x})+bu(\bar{x}-h)+cu(\bar{x}-2h),$$
we can expand in Taylor series and collect terms to have
$$D_2 u(\bar{x})=(a+b+c) u(\bar{x})-(b+2 c) h u^{\prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{2}(b+4 c) h^2 u^{\prime \prime}(\bar{x})-\frac{1}{6}(b+8 c) h^3 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\cdots.$$
If it is going to agree with $u'(\bar{x})$ to higher orders, we need
```math
\begin{aligned}
a+b+c & =0, \\
b+2 c & =-1 / h, \\
b+4 c & =0 .
\end{aligned}
```
Solving this linear system gives
$$a=3/2h, \quad b=-2/h, \quad c=1/2h,$$
and
$$D_2 u(\bar{x})=\frac{1}{2h}(3u(\bar{x})-4u(\bar{x}-h)+u(\bar{x}-2h)).$$
The error in this approximation is
$$D_2 u(\bar{x})-u^{\prime}(\bar{x}) = -\frac{1}{6}(b+8 c) h^3 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\cdots = -\frac{1}{3} h^2 u^{\prime \prime \prime}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^3\right).$$

## 1.1.3 Second order derivatives

The standard second order centered approximation $D^2 u(\bar{x})$ to the second derivative $u''(\bar{x})$ can be obtained by repeatedly applying first order differences.
By defining a centered approximation with step size $h/2$
$$\hat{D}_0 u(x) \equiv \frac{1}{h}\left(u\left(x+\frac{h}{2}\right)-u\left(x-\frac{h}{2}\right)\right),$$
we find that
```math
\begin{aligned}
D^2 u(\bar{x}) & =\hat{D}_0\left(\hat{D}_0 u(\bar{x})\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{h}\left(\left(\frac{u(\bar{x}+h)-u(\bar{x})}{h}\right)-\left(\frac{u(\bar{x})-u(\bar{x}-h)}{h}\right)\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{h^2}(u(\bar{x}-h)-2 u(\bar{x})+u(\bar{x}+h)) \\
& =u^{\prime \prime}(\bar{x})+\frac{1}{12} h^2 u^{(4)}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^4\right).
\end{aligned}
```
In fact, 
```math
\begin{aligned}
D^2 u(\bar{x}) & =\frac{1}{h}\left(\left(\frac{u(\bar{x}+h)-u(\bar{x})}{h}\right)-\left(\frac{u(\bar{x})-u(\bar{x}-h)}{h}\right)\right) \\
& =\frac{1}{h}\left(D_{-} u(\bar{x}+h)-D_{-} u(\bar{x})\right) \\
& =D_{+}\left(D_{-} u(\bar{x})\right) \\
& =D_{+} D_{-} u(\bar{x}).
\end{aligned}
```
Similarly, we have $D^2 u(\bar{x}) = D_{-} D_{+} u(\bar{x})$.

## 1.1.4 A general approach to deriving the coefficients

The method of undetermined coefficients in Section 1.1.2 can be extended to compute the finite difference coefficients of the approximation to $u^{(k)}(\bar{x})$, based on an arbitrary stencil of $n \geq k+1$ points $x_1, \ldots, x_n$. 
Assume that $u(x)$ is sufficiently smooth, i.e., at least $n+1$ times continuously differentiable in the interval containing $\bar{x}$ and all the stencil points, then the Taylor series expansions of $u$ at each stencil point $x_i$ about $\bar{x}$ yield
$$u\left(x_i\right)=u(\bar{x})+\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right) u^{\prime}(\bar{x})+\cdots+\frac{1}{k !}\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)^k u^{(k)}(\bar{x})+\cdots,$$
for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We want to find a linear combination of $u(x_1), \ldots, u(x_n)$ that agrees with $u^{(k)}(\bar{x})$ as well as possible. So we want
$$c_1 u\left(x_1\right)+c_2 u\left(x_2\right)+\cdots+c_n u\left(x_n\right)=u^{(k)}(\bar{x})+O\left(h^p\right),$$
where $p$ is as large as possible. Here $h$ is some measure of the width of the stencil such that $\max _{1 \leq i \leq n}\left|x_i-\bar{x}\right| \leq C h$ for some small contant $C$.
Following the approach of Section 1.1.2, we choose the coefficients $c_j$ such that
```math
\frac{1}{(i-1) !} \sum_{j=1}^n c_j\left(x_j-\bar{x}\right)^{i-1}= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } i-1=k \\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
```
for $i=1, \ldots, n$. Provided that the stencil points $x_j$ are distinct, the equivalent $n \times n$ **Vandermonde system**
```math
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & \cdots & 1 \\ x_1-\bar{x} & \cdots & x_n-\bar{x} \\ \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\ \frac{\left(x_1-\bar{x}\right)^k}{k !} & \cdots & \frac{\left(x_n-\bar{x}\right)^k}{k !} \\ \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\ \frac{\left(x_1-\bar{x}\right)^{n-1}}{(n-1) !} & \cdots & \frac{\left(x_n-\bar{x}\right)^{n-1}}{(n-1) !}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_k \\ \vdots \\ c_n\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{array}\right]
```
is nonsingular and has a unique solution.
