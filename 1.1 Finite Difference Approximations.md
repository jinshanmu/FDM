# 1.1 Finite Difference Approximations

Let $u(x)$ represent a smooth function of one variable over an interval containing a particular point of interest $\bar{x}$.
To approximate $u'(\bar{x})$ by a finite difference approximation based only on values of $u$ at a finite number of points near $\bar{x}$, one obvious choice would be 
$$D_{+} u(\bar{x}) \equiv \frac{u(\bar{x}+h)-u(\bar{x})}{h}\quad\text{(1.1.1)}$$
for some small value of $h$, which is a one-sided approximation to $u'$ since $u$ is evaluated only at values of $x\geq\bar{x}$.
